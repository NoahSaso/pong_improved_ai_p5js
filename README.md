pong_improved_ai_p5js
=====================

Simple pong game used to train an AI using the [NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) algorithm (with [Neataptic](https://github.com/wagenaartje/neataptic)) written in p5js (but better this time).

This is a fork of my other repository (pong_ai_p5js) with the goal of creating Pong AI that learns how to efficiently win, not how to keep the game going because it's playing against itself.

Mess with it here:

Instructions
============

Click `Play Trained AI` button at the bottom of the page to play my trained AI.

The right paddle will follow your mouse, and the left paddle is controlled by the AI.
